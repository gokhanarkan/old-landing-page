This is my personal landing page built with Vue.js and hosted with Netlify. The contact form is integrated with AWS Lambda and Node.js.

I will style this page similar to Edward Tufte's handouts. Check here for more: https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/

Hoping to add personal projects route soon. Not too soon, though.
