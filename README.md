This ~~is~~ was my personal landing page built with Vue.js and hosted on Netlify. The contact form was built with with AWS Lambda and Node.js.

The style was inspired by Edward Tufte's handouts. Check here for more: https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/

I no longer use this page, though I will keep it live for the old times' sake. You can check the source code of my new landing page [here](https://github.com/gokhj/gokhanarkan.com).
